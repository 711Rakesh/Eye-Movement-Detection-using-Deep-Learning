# Eye-Movement-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
: The "Eye Movement Detection using Deep Learning" project aims to develop a machine learning system capable of provide information whether someone eye is open or close. This eye detection model can help drivers if they get sleep during driving, then with the help of alarm system they can easily break their sleep.
